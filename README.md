# ViMouse
My submission for the 2019 ProgrammerHumor Hackathon, with the theme "Overengineering".

This project was inspired by some memes I've seen regarding Vim users, in which said user never touches their mouse and performs all operations using solely their keyboard. 

Disclaimer: I've never actually used Vim.

Warning: this program will not allow you to move your mouse until you terminate it.

## Commands
    :q - Terminates the program.
    :help - Displays this help message.
    :left <px> - Moves the mouse left by the specified amount of pixels.
    :right <px> - Moves the mouse right by the specified amount of pixels.
    :up <px> - Moves the mouse up by the specified amount of pixels.
    :down <px> - Moves the mouse down by the specified amount of pixels.

Commands can be chained by simply adding a space instead of a newline.

For example: `:left 100 :up 100` will move the cursor 100 pixels to the left and 100 pixels up.
